# Figure out the most popular movie by counting the number of ratings by movie
# Here, we print the movie name along with the movie ID
# The "u.item" of the MovieLens dataset gives us the mapping for MovieID - Movie Name
# We could use a DataSet to map movie ID's to names, then join it with our ratings dataset - but this comes 
# with unneccessary overhead and is suitable only when our dataset has so many unique movie IDs to than what 
# can be fit in the memory of a single executor machine (which is not the case - not much data in our case).
# We could also just keep a dictionary loaded in this driver program by reading the "u.item" file, or we could 
# even let SPARK automatically forward it to each executor when needed. But what if the table was massive ? 
# We'd only want to transfer it once to each executor and keep it there (as a Broadcast variable).

# We can Broadcast objects to the executors, such that they are always there whenever needed, using sc.broadcast(obj) on SparkContext object.
# The object can be got by using obj.value(). The Boradcaster object can be used however you want (in map functions, UDFs, etc)
